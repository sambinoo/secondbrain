# building my secondbrain
**Goal**: I want to create a second brain to log personal bits of knowledge that I can reference back to as I develop my career. This README file is a work in progress and my hope is to update this frequently as I fumble through creating this tool. My secondary goals are to gain practical exposure to Python, SQL, APIs, databases, and Github. 

The project will be broken up into three components:
- Twitter, the data input source
- A database, a location to store data inputs
- A dashboard, the data exported to a UI for a tailored view

## Phase 1:
- explore Twitter API / developer resources to scrape / export personal tweets 
- create a local or public database to store raw data
  - would like to explore non-local options 
- leverage Twitter via [@samsecondbrain](https://twitter.com/samsecondbrain) to create new entries for second brain database
  - may use my personal Twitter [@sambino](https://twitter.com/sambino) to mix my content and keep access convenient

## Phase 2: 
- format / filter tweet metadata / content upon export
  - implement my own metadata through the tweet content, ex. `Category: Finance`, `Subject: Crypto`, `Topic: Art`
- populate table(s) with expected metadata

## Phase 3: 
- create a web page / dashboard 
- export table content to dashboard
